/// backs KIP-599, rate limiting for partition mutations. For a more generic
/// implementation check out utils/ until these are merged.
///
/// Keeps track of a limited number of resources known as 'tokens'.
/// The current amount of tokens are kept in \ref bucket and when a user
/// consumes resources they take a corresponding number of tokens from the
/// bucket. Every \ref window duration the pre-configured amount of units are
/// added to the bucket. If there are enough tokens in the bucket when queried
/// the algorithm recommends rate-limiting, otherwise not.
