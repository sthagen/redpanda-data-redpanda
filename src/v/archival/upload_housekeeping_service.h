/// The service uses two timers and subscribes to cloud_storage::remote
/// notifications. The idle timer fires frequently and triggers transition to
/// the active state. Every time the service receives notification from the
/// cloud_storage::remote it resets the timer so if the cloud storage is busy
/// the idle timer will never be triggered and its callback will never be
/// called.
///
/// The 'epoch' timer runs less frequently. Notifications from the cloud
/// storage do not reset it. So it will be triggered eventually if the cloud
/// storage is always busy. The callback of the epoch timer initiates transition
/// to the active state. It's purpose is to make sure that the housekeeping job
/// is perfomed even when the cloud storage is always busy. This will drain the
/// backlog (the job queue) so it's guaranteed that every job is executed at
/// least once per epoch.
///
/// The noticifactions from the cloud storage API reset the idle timer so if the
/// cloud storage is busy it will never be triggered. If any of the jobs uses
/// the cloud storage API the notifications from it will be ignored.
///
/// The service might be stopped by calling 'stop' method. In this case method
/// 'interrupt' of the job will be called if there is a job which is executing
/// at the moment. The 'ntp_archiver_service' has to deregister and stop its
/// job before deletion.
///
/// The following configuration parameters are used:
/// - cloud_storage_idle_timeout_ms: the service goes into active state when
///   remote api is not active for cloud_storage_idle_timeout_ms milliseconds.
/// - cloud_storage_housekeeping_interval_ms: epoch timeout. The service goes
///   active state forcibly, even if remote api is not idle.
/// - cloud_storage_segment_upload_timeout x 3: if service is stopping being
///   active for longer than 3x segment upload timeout the state is stopped
///   forcibly and the error is generated.
