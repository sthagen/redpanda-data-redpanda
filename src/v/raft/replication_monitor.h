 * This class is hooked up with consensus for the following event
 * updates
 *   1. offset committed
 *   2. offset majority replicated (without flush)
 *
 * Internally this class maintains a list of waiters for these events.
 * The main work loop that notifies these waiters runs out side of
 * consensus op lock. The waiters are also notified of the truncation
 * event if the desired offset is truncated in case of a leadership change.
